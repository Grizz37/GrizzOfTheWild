        <h2>About Me</h2>
    </main>
    <p> My name is Brandon Baldwin, but I also go by my handle: Grizz. I have always been drawn to technology. I've
        taken apart and reassembled, modified, repaired and even built peices of hardware from video game consoles up to
        Personal Computers (PCs). I enjoy creating in multiple different mediums, including visual media projects.
        Outside of
        tinkering with electronics and creative projects I also love the sport of hockey, both watching and playing!
    </p> <br>
    <p>
        I want to become a software engineer to broaden my personal and professional skillset. My affinity for
        technology has always naturally flowed into my hobbies and personal vetnures, but to grow these skillsets beyond
        my imagination and to apply them in
        a professional setting.. I struggle to think of a more fitting, worthwhile and enjoyable pursuit!</p>
